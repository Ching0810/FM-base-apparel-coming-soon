## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox & grid system
- Position system
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Follow mobile first principle to finish responsive web design
2. Use <picture>, <source> element to achieve RWD design
3. Use <img> element combine with object-fit, height & width property to control background image always as height as card

### Continued development

1. Simplify redundant class and merge multiple CSS setting


### Useful resources
